## Prerequisites
- NET 7 SDK (https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0)
</br>
This dependency is guaranteed regardless of what you do with the project, as it is required for building.

Other prequisites are recommended but can be swapped out or ignored.
- The web api requires SQL server (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads) or a different DB which can be swapped out using ef configurations.
- For native, Avalonia is needed so you can install the VS extension at (https://avaloniaui.net/GettingStarted#installation)
- TypeScript is used on the front end web application, but you could just use the native applications + web api instead.
- Tailwind CSS is also a front end requirement.
- Both TypeScript and Tailwind depend on NodeJS so you would also need to install it (https://nodejs.org/en/download)
